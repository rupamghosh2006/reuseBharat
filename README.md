# Reuse Bharat

## Overview  
Reuse Bharat is a unified platform designed to reduce resource wastage in India by connecting surplus food, educational materials, and near-expiry medicines with those in need. The platform builds a circular economy through real-time coordination, verified networks, and transparent systems powered by Web2 and Web3 technologies.

---

## Problem Statement  
**PS: 10 OPEN INNOVATION:**

India wastes approximately 78–80 million tonnes of food annually, generates around 484 tonnes of biomedical waste daily, and has over 40 million college students leading to large volumes of unused educational resources, while nearly 194 million people remain undernourished. The core issue is the lack of real-time coordination and trust between surplus and demand.

---

## Solution  
Reuse Bharat provides a single ecosystem that enables efficient redistribution of resources across food, education, and healthcare, ensuring surplus resources reach the right people at the right time.

## About

Reuse Bharat is a unified platform designed to reduce resource wastage in India by connecting surplus food, educational materials, and near-expiry medicines with those in need. The platform focuses on building a circular economy through real-time coordination, verified networks, and transparent data systems powered by Web2 and Web3 technologies.

## Problem Statement

India faces significant resource wastage while many lack access to essential items:
- **Textbooks & Educational Materials** - Students cannot afford expensive books
- **Near-expiry Medicines** - Wasted while others need them
- **Surplus Food** - Restaurants throw away excess food daily
- **Underutilized Items** - Electronics, furniture, and other goods sit unused

## Solution

CampusMarketplace enables:
- Students to buy/sell used textbooks at affordable prices
- Verified seller/buyer networks
- Real-time data on available items
- Transparent blockchain Record-keeping
- No transaction fees via off-chain payment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reuse-bharat.git
cd reuse-bharat

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Compile Contracts

```bash
npm run compile
```

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network celoSepolia
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

## Contract Functions

```solidity
// Write Functions
function listItem(title, description, price, category, condition, imageURI) → itemId
function markAsSold(itemId) → marks item sold
function updateItem(itemId, title, description, price, category, condition, imageURI)
function deleteItem(itemId)

// Read Functions
function getActiveItems() → Item[]
function getItemsByCategory(Category) → Item[]
function getItemsByPriceRange(minPrice, maxPrice) → Item[]
function getItemsByCondition(Condition) → Item[]
function getSellerItems(seller) → Item[]
function getBuyerItems(buyer) → Item[]
function getItem(itemId) → Item
```

## Deployment

| Network | Contract Address | Transaction Hash |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Celo Sepolia | `0x0f4A570a593F27Fa78Bf09F4F0301Ae41c4ee075` | `0x6f32f09731824a135b3cff6d7bea7440344e9f362e596ebe2ebdd0534e2e1029` |

**Explorer**: [Celo Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.celoscan.io/address/0x0f4A570a593F27Fa78Bf09F4F0301Ae41c4ee075)

## Project Structure

```
├── contracts/
│   └── CampusMarketplace.sol  # Data storage only
├── scripts/

├── hardhat.config.js      # Network configuration

└── README.md
```

## How It Works

1. **Seller** calls `listItem()` → stores product data on-chain
2. **Buyer** views items via `getActiveItems()` or filters
3. **Buyer** contacts seller off-chain (via app) → payment done off-chain
4. **Seller** calls `markAsSold()` → updates status on-chain

> **Note**: No wallet connection, no token transfers - only data is stored on blockchain.

## Security

- Never expose your private key
- Use testnet for development
- Verify contract address before interacting
- Review smart contract code before deployment
